# First steps

`rbx` (short for {{rbx}} for setters) is the CLI tool {{rbx}} provides for setters to prepare contests and problems.

You can start creating a new problem from a pre-initialized template by running `rbx create [name]`.

<!--termynal-->
```bash
$ rbx create test
# This will create a `test` directory under the current
# working directory with a pre-initialized problem template.
```

This is how the directory structure of the pre-initialized problem template will look like:

```bash
test
├── sols  # (1)!
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── slow.cpp
│   └── wa.cpp
├── statement  # (2)!
│   ├── olymp.sty
│   ├── projecao.png
│   ├── statement.rbx.tex
│   └── template.rbx.tex
├── tests  # (3)!
│   └── samples
│       ├── 000.in
│       └── 001.in
├── gen.cpp # (4)!
├── problem.rbx.yml # (5)!
├── random.txt # (6)!
├── random.py # (7)!
├── validator.cpp # (8)!
└── wcmp.cpp # (9)!
```

1.  All solutions for the problem: the correct and the incorrect ones.
2.  All statement-related assets, including the legend of the problem itself
    but also the tex templates and imported graphics.
3.  Manually defined tests of the problem.

    !!! note
        Automatically generated tests are not defined by explicit input and output files, but are rather defined by generator entries in the problem configuration.

4.  An example of a {{testlib}} generator. In this case, the generator is used to
    generate testcases for two testgroups: `random` and `program-random`.

    !!! note
        A problem can have multiple generators. This one is just an example.

5.  The {{YAML}} configuration file for this problem.
6.  A generator script for the problem.

    Each line of a generator script describes one call to a generator, and a generator script groups all these calls together.

    Example:

    ```
    gen 123
    gen 456
    ```

    Calls the generator named `gen` (here in this problem, implemented through `gen.cpp`) twice, thus generating two testcases.

    In this problem, this script is used to generate the testcase group `random`.

7.  A program that outputs a generator script. Pretty similar to `random.txt`
    above, except that this is a program that prints to the **stdout** a
    generator script, and thus provides more flexibility to the setter.

    Example:

    ```python
    #! /usr/bin/python3
    for i in range(10):
        print(f'gen {i}')
    ```

    This program outputs a generator script that creates 10 testcases with increasing
    parameter `i`.

    In this problem, this program is used to generate the testcase group `program-random`.

8.  A {{testlib}} validator that checks whether the generated tests are
    in the correct format.

9.  A built-in {{testlib}} checker that compares tokens of the participant's output
    and the judge's output.

## Build

Let's skip the configuration of the problem for a second, and just build and run it. You can build a problem with {{rbx.build}}. This will populate a `build` folder inside your problem's folder with all the testcases generated for the problem.

```{.bash .no-copy}
$ rbx build
$ ls build
build
│   └── tests
│       ├── program-random
│       │   └── ...
│       ├── random
│       │   └── ...
│       └── samples
│           └── ...
```

You can notice it created several folders inside a `tests` directory, each of which contains the tests for a specific testgroup. For this template in particular, we have three testsets: `random`, `program-random` and `samples`. We'll go into more details about each one of these in a minute.

## Run

Now, let's execute {{rbx.run}}. This command **builds** all testcases and **executes** each solution against them, evaluating whether each solution had the expected outcome.

```bash
$ rbx run
```

You can see this command prints a full run report: it shows for each testcase of each testgroup whether a certain solution passed or not. There are also links for the outputs of each problem.

!!! tip
    You can notice when you called {{rbx.run}}, the testcases were built really fast.
    That's because {{rbx}} caches certain calls based on the hash tree of your package
    (similar to Makefile). You can explicitly clear this cache by calling {{rbx.clean}}.

## Modifying the package

As you can see from the solutions and the statement, the pre-initialized template simply implements a problem where you have to add up two numbers `A` and `B`. Let's modify the problem to _compute the sum of N numbers_.

### Rewrite solutions

Let's start rewriting the solutions. We can probably drop the slow solution since we're just naively summing numbers anyway.

We can develop the following {{tags.accepted}} and {{tags.wrong_answer}} solutions.

=== "sols/main.cpp"
    ```c++
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    int32_t main() {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        int64_t ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            ans += x;
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    ```

=== "sols/wa.cpp"
    ```c++
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    int32_t main() {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        int32_t ans = 0; // int32 overflows!!
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            ans += x;
        }

        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    ```

To delete the `slow.cpp` solution from our package, we can just delete the file and the reference to it in `problem.rbx.yml`. The reference is located in the `solutions` section, which will look like this after the deletion:

```yaml
solutions:
  - path: 'sols/main.cpp'
    outcome: ACCEPTED
  - path: 'sols/wa.cpp'
    outcome: WRONG_ANSWER
```

You can find the full list of expected outcomes [here][rbx.box.schema.ExpectedOutcome].

### Write the validator

The {{testlib}} validator is implemented by `validator.cpp` and will look like this:


=== "validator.cpp"
    ```c++
    #include "testlib.h"

    using namespace std;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        registerValidation(argc, argv);
        prepareOpts(argc, argv);

        int MAX_N = opt<int>("MAX_N"); // (1)!

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i) inf.readSpace();
            inf.readInt(1, MAX_N, "A_i");
        }
        inf.readEoln();
        inf.readEof();
    }
    ```

    1.  `MAX_N` is a variable defined in `problem.rbx.yaml` that is accessible
        in the validator. It allows you to change the constraints of the problem,
        and instantly replicate the change in validators and statements.

### Generating random testcases

Now, let's rewrite our random generator to generate `N` numbers instead of only two.

We have to actually call this generator and generate testcases into some of the testgroups.

Let's delete the existing test groups in `problem.rbx.yml`, except for the `samples` one, and create a new `main_tests` group. Let's generate 10 random tests for this group by using a generator script. We can end up with the following files:

=== "gen.cpp"
    ```c++
    #include "testlib.h"

    using namespace std;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        registerGen(argc, argv, 1); // (1)!

        int n = rnd.next(1, opt<int>(1));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i) cout << " ";
            cout << rnd.next(1, opt<int>(2));
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    ```

    1.  The generator now receive two parameters `MAX_N` (accessed through `#!c++ opt<int>(1)`) and `MAX_A` (accessed through `#!c++ opt<int>(2)`).

=== "random.py"
    ```python
    for i in range(10):
        print(f'gen 1000 1000000000 {i}') # (1)!
    ```

    1.  This line defines 10 random calls to the generator `gen`, 
        which will in turn generate testcases with `N` randomly varying
        from 1 to 1000 and the numbers to be added varying from 1 to `1e9`.

        !!! tip
            Notice the trailing `{i}` being printed in every generator script line.
            That's because {{testlib}} rng seed is initialized from the `argv` given to
            the generator.
            
            Thus generators are reproducible: if we called `gen 1000` 10 times, we
            would always get the same result. By appending an extra variable `{i}`,
            we introduce randomness to the tests.

=== "problem.rbx.yml"
    ```yaml
    # Testcases section would look like:

    testcases:
    - name: 'samples'
        testcaseGlob: 'tests/samples/*.in'
    - name: 'main_tests'  # (1)!
        generatorScript:
            path: 'random.py'
    ```
    
    1.  Here, `main_tests` would contain the 10 tests defined in `random.py`.

Now, if we run {{rbx.build}}, we'd get our brand new generated tests.

### Update the statement

Of course, last but not least, we have to update the statement of our problem. {{rbx}}
has its own statement format, called {{rbxTeX}}.

In `statement/statement.rbx.tex` you will find something like the following:

=== "statement/statement.rbx.tex"
    ```tex
    %- block legend
    Dado dois números inteiros $A$ e $B$, determine o valor de $A + B$.

    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{projecao.png}
    %- endblock

    %- block input
    A entrada é composta por uma única linha contendo dois números
    inteiros $A$ e $B$ ($1 \leq A, B \leq \VAR{vars.MAX_N | sci}$). % (1)!
    %- endblock

    %- block output
    A saída deve conter somente um único inteiro, a soma de $A$ e $B$.
    %- endblock

    %- block notes
    Sem muitas notas pra este problema.
    %- endblock
    ```

    1.  Notice the use of `\VAR` here, which is a command {{rbxTeX}} exposes for
        you to access variables defined in `problem.rbx.yml`, similar to how you
        accessed these in the {{testlib}} validator.

        The template engine used to expand `\VAR{...}` is Jinja2. This means we can also
        use filters. Here in particular, we're using a pre-defined filter implemented
        by {{rbxTeX}} called `sci`. This filter converts numbers with lots of zeroes (for instance, 100000), into their scientific notations (`10^5`).

As you can see, similar to {{polygon}}, you write a few blocks of LaTeX that are expanded into a template. Here, the `%` delimits those pre-defined blocks. Your statement needs at least a _legend_, an _input_ and an _output_.

Let's change each corresponding block to match our new problem description.

=== "statement/statement.rbx.tex"
    ```tex
    %- block legend
    Given $N$ integers, print their sum.
    %- endblock

    %- block input
    The input has a single line containing $N$ 
    ($1 \leq N \leq \VAR{vars.MAX_N | sci}$) numbers. 
    These numbers range from 1 to $\VAR{vars.MAX_A | sci}$.
    %- endblock

    %- block output
    Print the sum of the integers.
    %- endblock

    %- block notes
    No notes.
    %- endblock
    ```

## Advanced configuration

If you want to do more advanced changes to the package, you can continue reading our Reference section on the sidebar.

## Package the problem

To build you problem, you can use the `rbx package [platform]` command.

Here, we'll build a {{polygon}} package with our statement, and as such we'll need LaTeX dependencies installed to compile it to a PDF. You can read more about a few recommendations we have to install pdfLaTeX and other common dependencies [here](pdflatex.md).

!!! note
    Packages usually require a statement to be built.
    
    You can try running `rbx package [platform] --no-statement`, but an error might be raised in case such platform does not support packages without statements.

```bash
$ rbx package polygon
```

A {{polygon}} package will be built. This package can be directly uploaded to the [Codeforces Gym](https://codeforces.com/gyms) through FTP.
